# ACRE 2 Custom Signal (CUSSIG)
This PBO provides a method for mission makers/scripters to diminish, block, or otherwise boost acre radio signals in an area. This can be assigned to an object that can be destroyed, for the functionality to be dynamically altered. For example a Jammer on a tower, that once blown up, will reinstate radio communications.

This is based upon https://github.com/diwako/ACRE2-Custom-Signal-Calculation with alterations to make it work for within our use-case. Such as mission modules, for example.

The license for this PBO is included with this PBO. It is viewable as `license.txt`.

This is of course not possible without ACRE 2 itself, and the wonderful team that's created not only the addon, but the amazing documentation such as https://acre2.idi-systems.com/wiki/frameworks/custom-signal-processing.
